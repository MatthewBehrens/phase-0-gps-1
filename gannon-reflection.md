*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*
I was not always in the habit of creating a feature branch.

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*
Merging branches was clarified; our guide gave us valuable instruction.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*
My pair helped me with the organization and steps of git (i.e. creating a feature branch then adding a file). The guide answered a question about merging the base and origin on github. 

*What still confuses you about Git?*
I am fearful of larger merge conflicts and solving them. I'd still like to learn more commands in git.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*
It was very helpful to have a guide to lean back on when necessary. He left us alone, and guided us for the answer instead of directly giving us the answer.
